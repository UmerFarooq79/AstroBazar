        <h5>Embodying the Raw, Wayward Spirit of Rock 'N' Roll</h5>
        <p>
            Embodying the raw, wayward spirit of rock ‘n’ roll, the Kilburn
            portable active stereo speaker takes the unmistakable look and sound
            of Marshall, unplugs the chords, and takes the show on the road.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weighing in under 7 pounds, the Kilburn is a lightweight piece of
            vintage styled engineering. Setting the bar as one of the loudest
            speakers in its class, the Kilburn is a compact, stout-hearted hero
            with a well-balanced audio which boasts a clear midrange and
            extended highs for a sound that is both articulate and pronounced.
            The analogue knobs allow you to fine tune the controls to your
            personal preferences while the guitar-influenced leather strap
            enables easy and stylish travel.

            The FM radio is perhaps gone for good, the assumption apparently
            being that the jury has ruled in favor of streaming over the
            internet. The IR blaster is another feature due for retirement – the
            S6 had it, then the Note5 didn’t, and now with the S7 the trend is
            clear.
        </p>
        <h5>Perfectly Done</h5>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, the IP68 water resistance has improved from the S5,
            allowing submersion of up to five feet for 30 minutes, plus there’s
            no annoying flap covering the charging port
        </p>
        <ul className="pl-0">
            <li>No FM radio (except for T-Mobile units in the US, so far)</li>
            <li>No IR blaster</li>
            <li>No stereo speakers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you’ve taken the phone for a plunge in the bath, you’ll need to
            dry the charging port before plugging in. Samsung hasn’t reinvented
            the wheel with the design of the Galaxy S7, but it didn’t need to.
            The Gala S6 was an excellently styled device, and the S7 has managed
            to improve on that.
