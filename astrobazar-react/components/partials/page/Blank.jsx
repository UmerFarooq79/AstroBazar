                    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he
                    found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
                    He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a
                    little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and

                    like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my
                    whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in
                    this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like

                    exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect
                    my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke
                    at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a
                    greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems
                    with
