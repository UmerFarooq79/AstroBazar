                                Joining and starting a shop on Martfury is free. There are three
                                basic selling fees: a listing fee, a transaction fee, and a payment
                                processing fee.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It costs USD 0.20 to publish a listing to the marketplace. A listing
                                lasts for four months or until the item is sold. Once an item sells,
                                there is a 3.5% transaction fee on the sale price (not including
                                shipping costs). If you accept payments with PayPal, there is also a
                                payment processing fee based on their fee structure.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Listing fees are billed for $0.20 USD, so if your bank’s currency is
                                not USD, the amount may differ based on changes in the exchange
                                rate.

                                It’s easy to set up a shop on Martfury. Create an Martfury account
                                (if you don’t already have one), set your shop location and
                                currency, choose a shop name, create a listing, set a payment method
                                (how you want to be paid), and finally set a billing method (how you
                                want to pay your Martfuryfees).

                                If you accept payments with PayPal, funds from PayPal sales on
                                Martfury will be deposited into your PayPal account. We encourage
                                sellers to use a PayPal Business account and not a Personal account,
                                as personal accounts are subject to monthly receiving limits and
                                cannot accept payments from buyers that are funded by a credit card.

                                No, a credit or debit card is not required to create a shop. To be
                                verified as a seller you have the choice to use either a credit card
                                or to register via PayPal. You will not incur any charges until you
                                open your shop and publish your listings.
